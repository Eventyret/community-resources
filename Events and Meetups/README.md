### Meetups
#### Why Meetups are Important
Meetups are an amazing way for anyone to build a relationship with their local developer community. These are events often held monthly where people in the same location come together to chat, meet people with similar interests (as meetups are usually centered around a particular tool, technology, or product). Attending meetups has some amazing benefits both for organisers and attendees. 

For attendees...
- It's an amazing place to meet people! You get to meet people of all experience levels and have amazing conversations.
- You learn so much - from fellow attendees and speakers alike.
- You get job opportunities. Either through referrals or general advertising, meetups are a great place to start that job hunt.

For organizers...
- You get to grow your local developer community. 
- As much as you're part of the team making things happen, you're also part of the meetup and learning so much.
- You get to expand your network.


#### Starting a Meetup

Starting a meetup is a great choice to have made. Bear in mind that consistency is key. Put together a meetup title, description, and get a few invites out. You should have an idea of what your first session should look like and who will speak at it then you're good to go.

#### Promoting your Meetup

As with many things, you have to promote your meetup so that it can reach as many people as it can. People in your area interested in topics discussed at your meetup should be able to find it. Here is a list of places where you can do just that.

- [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) - Handles Promotion, communication and discussions. 
- [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) - Handles Promotion, attendee registration and check-in.
    
#### Looking for Speakers
At the core of your meetups are the sessions people give, because of this, speakers to give these sessions and talks are really important. It's good practice to open up a call for papers so people in your community can submit sessions to speak. Meetups are also a really good place for people to get started with public speaking so making the sessions open for beginners to apply is a really good initiative - as a meetup organiser, you should actively help and encourage first-timers. 

It is also  encouraged to invite speakers from other communities by posting your meetups call for papers on sites like [PaperCall.io](https://www.papercall.io/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com), or [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)

#### Meetup Logistics

Quite a bit goes into making sure meetups go on as smoothly as possible. Here's a quick overview that applies to both online and offline meetups.
  
- Introduce yourself as the meetup host
- Point out the Code of Conduct; it makes it clear how people should behave and what happens if they don't
- Give an outline of the agenda for the event
- Introduce the speaker 
- Gather feedback at the end

#### Staying Consistent 
Developers love consistency (according to this book I read), so to properly grow your meetup and keep your community engaged, you have to be consistent. Consistency means having a set schedule for meetups, meeting on the same of the week at uniform intervals. Consistency in branding and topic focus plays a huge part too. Do keep in mind that being consistent doesn't mean being boring. You don't want your community expecting the same things every time you gather.

### Speaking 
Speaking be it at conferences or meetups is an amazing way to share your knowledge while interacting with the developer community. Speaking like most activities in the resource comes with its benefits. 

- Your build your credibility as a developer and field expert
- If you want to, it's a great way to build your following
- You get to impart knowledge to your fellow community members

> If you have issues with approaching people to chat, it makes starting interactions easier as usually you get approached first. 

#### Getting Past Imposter Syndrome
[Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) is something speakers of all experience levels face. Most people question whether or not they are good enough to give a talk. Everyone is! What makes talks and sessions special are that everyone has their perspective of things and being able to package that as a talk will give an audience a fresh view of any topic. So yes, you are good enough to give that talk.

#### Looking for Conferences
Looking for conferences, (or meetups) to speak at isn't an easy task.

#### Creating a Proposal
Once you've found an event to speak at, unless you've been invited to speak (most times even if you've been invited) you're going to have to prepare a talk or session proposal. 

Topics can be hard to come by, a good place to start with topics is asking yourself one or more of these questions. 
- What am I passionate about? *Mechanical Keyboards? Give that talk*
- What have I recently learned that could be great to share?
- What lessons have a learned from a recent experience? 

Some tips for crafting a winning proposal?
- Read the submission form to get a feel of what the event wants.
- Look at talks accepted in the past
- Submit a talk as soon as you can 

#### Creating Slides

It's possible to give a great talk without, slides. Slides do however help people follow your point. Here are some tips and pointers to remember as you go about creating slides for your talk.

- Think about accessibility and keep in mind slide contrast
- Make your font size big enough to be readable from the back 
- Keep your presentation at one idea slide
- Don't distract the audience with too much text or imagery
- Don't fill your slides with code

This article titled [How to Take Your Talk Slides to the Next Level](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/en/articles/btc-talk-slides-conference) is a great resource and guide to supplement the points above.

#### Giving your talk

Practice makes perfect, the first part of giving your talk is practicing it. It makes for a better live presentation. As you go on and give your talk, make sure you're hydrated and have some water near you. Sipping water during your talk is a great way to pace yourself, stay hydrated, and also make sure you're not out of breath as you speak. 

As you start your talk, it's okay to be nervous.. don't worry you're doing amazing. Make sure to add an activity to your talk that can take some of the nerves away. Good ideas are engaging the crowd, adding a meme to your slides (my personal favourite), or putting on your lucky socks and telling the audience about - anything to make you comfortable. 

Make sure to ask the audience for feedback - it's always nice to see areas of your talk that could be better.
